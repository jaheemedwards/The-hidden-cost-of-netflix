# The-hidden-cost-of-netflix

Akinola Best is studying law in Barbados. Recently, some friends at school introduced her to Netflix. Akinola would like to find sometime to binge watch her favorite shows (of which there are many). However, her weekly schedule may not allow it. The following tables summarize how Akinola spends her time. One of Akinola’s friends recommend that she employ the services of a new startup UBingeWeClean, to free up some time for her to indulge in Netflix. The company charges $3.14 /hr Mondays – Fridays and $6.45 /hr on Saturdays and Sundays.

Akinola is on a strict budget, so she would like to estimate how much her Netflix indulgence will cost her. Based on the information above, the Python simulation determines the mean and standard deviation of the projected daily, weekly, and monthly cost to Akinola using the services of UBingeWeClean. This program displays the probability distribution of the predicted daily cost to Akinola.
